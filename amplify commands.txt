1. Use amplify CLI to incorporate pre-built User Pool / Client

(for reference: https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/auth/import/)

amplify --version
amplify init

-> Create a new IAM user
-> AWS Profile (select existing profile)

amplify import auth
-> User pool only (import the right user pool)

amplify status (to verify it was successful)
amplify push

2. Use pre-built UI components

(for reference: https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/js/#enable-sign-up-sign-in-and-sign-out )
